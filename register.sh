message="
This script will modify your FreeIPA setup so that this server can automatically
apply for LetsEncrypt SSL/TLS certificates for all hostnames/principals associted.

This script needs the host to be already registered in FreeIPA, the IPA client
is installed and that the user running this script is in the IPA admins group.

The following steps will be taken:

1. Adding the Let's Encrypt Root and Intermediate CAs as trusted CAs in your cert store.
2. Installing CertBot (Let's Encrypt client)
3. Create a DNS Administrator role in FreeIPA, members of which can edit DNS Records
4. Create a new service, allow it to manage DNS entries
5. Allow members of the admin group to create and retrieve keytabs for the service
6. Create bogus TXT initialization records for the host.
